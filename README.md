# Dynamic RAG-Based Customer Support Assistant

A realistic AI customer support assistant powered by LangGraph, allowing users to upload specific PDFs dynamically at runtime and query them seamlessly using a context-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. No fixed local PDFs; everything is dynamic and workspace-isolated.

## Capabilities
- **Dynamic User Uploads**: Upload one or multiple PDFs at runtime.
- **Isolated Context Sessions**: Answers use only the currently active uploaded documents. ChromaDB collections are created dynamically per session ID.
- **LangGraph Orchestration**: Robust workflow routing (Input → Route/Intent → Retrieve Context → Evaluate → Generate/Clarify/Fallback/Escalate).
- **Trust-Aware Generation**: Fallback mechanisms prevent hallucinations outside of the uploaded contexts.
- **HITL Architecture**: Automated requests for clarification on vague inputs and structured escalation for complex/legal/billing issues. Features a mock Human Reviewer dashboard in Streamlit.
- **Streamlit GUI**: Interactive and easy to use.

## Setup & Run

1. **Install Requirements:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and assign your `GROQ_API_KEY` and `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Start the Application:**
Run the Streamlit wrapper via main script:
```bash
python app/main.py
```
Or directly:
```bash
streamlit run app/ui/streamlit_app.py
```

## Sample Run Flow
1. **Upload Documents:** Start a new session. Drag `Employee_Handbook.pdf` into the sidebar.
2. **Process:** Click "Process & Index Documents". The system automatically cleans text, chunks, embeds with Sentence Transformers / OpenAI, and saves to a bespoke ChromaDB collection for the session.
3. **Valid Question:** Ask *"What is the PTO policy?"*
    - LangGraph Route: `retrieve` -> `evaluate` (YES sufficient) -> `generate`.
    - Outputs valid, source-cited answer.
4. **Vague Question:** Ask *"Hi, I need help."*
    - LangGraph Route: `clarify`.
    - Outputs: *"Hi there! How can I assist you with your uploaded documents today?"*
5. **Unsupported Question:** Ask *"Who won the Super Bowl last year?"*
    - LangGraph Route: `retrieve` -> `evaluate` (NO sufficient context).
    - Outputs Fallback: *"I'm sorry, I don't see enough info in the uploaded documents."*
6. **Escalation Case:** Ask *"I'm going to sue you for billing issues."*
    - LangGraph Route: `escalate`.
    - Outputs escalation warning and files a pending ticket in the Sidebar hits dashboard!
